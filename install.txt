Using the Startup Folder
Press Win + R, type shell:startup, and hit Enter to open the Startup folder for the current user.

Place a shortcut of your EXE file in this folder.

The program will launch automatically at every user sign-in with standard permissions.

Using the Registry for User-Level Startup
Open regedit (no admin needed for HKCU).

Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.

Add a new string value with the path to your EXE.

The program will start on user login, without admin rights.
